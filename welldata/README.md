# WellData - Preventive Health Data Management

WellData is an application designed to enable citizens to manage their own preventive health data in a SOLID Pod, while also enabling secondary use of such data for policy makers and researchers. It represents a prototype implementation of a European Health Data Space focused on preventive health.

## Vision

WellData aims to create a citizen-centric health data ecosystem where:

1. Citizens have full control over their preventive health data
2. Data can be shared across multiple health applications without duplication
3. Anonymized data can be used for research and policy-making with citizen consent
4. Communities can be motivated to improve health outcomes through social engagement

## Current Features

- User authentication with OpenID Connect via SOLID
- Automatic creation of welldata container structure in user's SOLID Pod
- FHIR-based data structure for storing health plans and goals
- Container and resource management
- Modern, responsive UI with Chakra UI

## Roadmap Features

- **Leaderboards**: 
  - Citizen Engagement Leaderboard: Promoting user onboarding to gain control over their health data
  - Data Solidarity Leaderboard: Benchmarking cities by percentage of citizens supporting health data sharing
  - Initially populated with mock data, later with real anonymized statistics

- **Personal Health Goals Management**:
  - Interface for users to add and manage personal health goals
  - Goal suggestions based on supported WellData system capabilities

- **Connected App Ecosystem**:
  - Integration with existing health applications:
    - [Selfcare](https://selfcare4me.com/)
    - [Zipster](https://www.zipster.care/)
    - [Bibopp](https://bibopp.be/)
  - Shared data access through user's SOLID Pod to avoid duplicate data entry

### Explanation:
- The **User's SOLID Pod** contains:
  - **Health Data** (managed by apps like Selfcare, Zipster, and Bibopp).
  - **Personal Goals** (set and updated by these apps).
  - **Connected Apps** (indicating integration with WellData).
- **Apps (Selfcare, Zipster, and Bibopp)**:
  - Can **read and write** both Health Data and Goals.
  - Avoid **duplicate data entry** by syncing via the Pod.
- **Secondary Use (Future Feature)**:
  - **Policy Makers** and **Researchers** may request **aggregated, user-controlled data**.
  - The **general public** sees very aggregated data, e.g. via the leaderboards

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5175 in your browser

## Working with Solid Authentication and WebID

WellData uses SOLID for decentralized data storage, giving users full control over their health data.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**:
   - The application redirects to the Solid identity provider (http://localhost:3000)
   - The user logs in with their credentials
   - After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application
   - The application automatically creates the welldata container structure if it doesn't exist

2. **Using Your Local WebID**:
   - For development, use the WebID generated by your local Community Solid Server
   - This WebID is typically in the format: `http://localhost:3000/[pod-name]/profile/card#me`

## Development Guidelines

1. **Always use the local WebID for development**:
   - This avoids CORS issues and simplifies the development process
   - The local WebID is automatically configured with the correct permissions

2. **Understanding the WellData Container Structure**:
   - The application creates a structured container in the user's Pod
   - This structure follows FHIR standards for health data
   - See the [Technical Details](./docs/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md) for more information

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.
