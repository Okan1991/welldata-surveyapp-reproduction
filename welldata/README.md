# Solid Pod Manager - Alternative UI

This is an alternative UI for managing Solid Pods, built with React and Chakra UI. It demonstrates how multiple applications can authenticate and access the same Solid Pod, which is a key feature of the Solid ecosystem.

## Features

- User authentication with OpenID Connect
- Container management (create, list, delete)
- File management (view, delete)
- Modern, responsive UI with Chakra UI
- Different styling from the first app

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser

## Working with Solid Authentication and WebID

This application uses the same local WebID and Pod as the first application. The key point is that both applications can authenticate and access the same Pod, demonstrating the interoperability of Solid applications.

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**:
   - The application redirects to the Solid identity provider (http://localhost:3000)
   - The user logs in with their credentials
   - After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application
   - The application can now make authenticated requests to the Solid server

2. **Using Your Local WebID**:
   - For development, use the WebID generated by your local Community Solid Server
   - This WebID is typically in the format: `http://localhost:3000/[pod-name]/profile/card#me`

## Development Guidelines

1. **Always use the local WebID for development**:
   - This avoids CORS issues and simplifies the development process
   - The local WebID is automatically configured with the correct permissions

2. **Test with the same Pod as the first app**:
   - This demonstrates how multiple applications can work with the same Pod
   - Changes made in one app should be visible in the other

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.
